# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-12)

**Core value:** A user can look up a specific pack/box/ETB and see whether it's priced fairly right now, backed by both live eBay asking prices and actual sold-price history.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — eBay API Feasibility Gate

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (eBay API Feasibility Gate)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-12 — Roadmap created (8 phases, horizontal-layer build, sold-price isolated as contingent Phase 8)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Horizontal-layer build (data model/catalog → ingestion → matching → API → frontend), not vertical MVP slices.
- [Roadmap]: Sold-price features (INGEST-04, PRICE-04/05/06) isolated in contingent Phase 8; Phases 1-7 ship a complete active-price v1 independent of Marketplace Insights API approval.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 is a feasibility/access gate — MI API access is a go/no-go decision resolved early, not a build assumption.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [Phase 1 → Phase 8]: Marketplace Insights API access is approval-gated and may be denied; Phase 8 (sold-price) is contingent on the Phase 1 outcome.
